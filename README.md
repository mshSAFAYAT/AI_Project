A Lab project on PDDL

There is a new startup restaurant which provides two types of food services. They are: 1. Dine in the restaurant and 2. Takeaway. 
The restaurant sells three types of foods: Burger, Coke, and Ice-cream. Burger costs 2$, Ice-cream costs 1$ and Coke costs 50 cents. 
In Dine-in, customers can order all three foods in different quantities and foods will be served at the restaurant's table by the waiter and there will be no delivery cost for this. 
In takeaway, customers can only order Burger and Coke of different quantities and foods will be delivered by the delivery man. 
Food can be delivered to different areas inside the city and delivery charge will vary depending on the areas.
